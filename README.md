# Instructor code challenge for General Assembly (Node.js)
- Backend: Node.js/Express, jade
- FrontEnd: jQuery (css: TBD)
- Staged here: https://ga-instructor-jseminara.herokuapp.com

This is the rough, working version of the IMDB movie search application, without extensive styling. 

**Note: There isn't any style applied; this version is just to demonstrate required functionality**

###Todo
- Apply fluid style & better design (move more-details, favorites onto one fluid page)
- Live updating of favorites in a sidebar (like a shopping cart)
- Create 'unfavorite' feature (RESTful DELETE: /favorite/:oid) to manage favorites list
- swap out "Add to favorites" link to "remove favorite" when POST returns
